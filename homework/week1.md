Ok, this one is easy. All I want you to do is to log in to github.com. Create a repository for yourself. Think of this repository as the place where you will store all of your scripts for this term. Initialize the repository with a readme.md file. This 'readme' file is a simple file that explains the point of a repository. 

Once you have done that, it would be awesome if you could use GitHub Desktop (or git at the command line; LMK if you want to learn that option) to 'clone' the repository to wherever it is that you would like to work. This could be to your personal computer, it could be to the z: space you have on the engineering computers, it is up to you.

Nothing to turn in here, nothing to grade, but please do this in advance of next Tuesday's class.
