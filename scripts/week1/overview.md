# Introduction to Matlab

Ok, here we are going to talk about the basic operation of Matlab. If you've seen / used Matlab before, this will be very much a review. 

##Basic Orientation

When you open Matlab you will see something like this:

There are four basic panels:
1. *Left* - this is like Explorer or Finder. You see a list of folders / files that are located in your current folder. And, by the way, where does matlab 'start'? Great question, complicated answer. Depends on your operating system and how you set your preferences. There is some advantage to identifying some ‘userpath’ (e.g., ‘/Users/dfh/Documents/MATLAB’). And, simply store all of your files there! The advantage is that this userpath will ALWAYS be added to Matlab’s ‘path’ (more on that later). 
2. *Center* – this is your ‘command window,’ where you will spend most of your time. You can issue commands, run files, etc., from here.
3. *Upper right* – this is your ‘workspace’ listing. Here, you see a list of all variables that are presently defined. When you start Matlab (and have not yet done anything) this will be empty.
4. *Lower right* – this is your ‘command history.’ This is a super useful feature that keeps an archive / history of recently executed commands.

Across the top, you see a ‘ribbon’ style toolbar with many, many buttons. The appearance of this window, and this toolbar, will vary depending upon your particular platform (Mac, etc.). The exact appearance of the window is highly customizable. For example, use the ‘Layout’ dropdown to select a different configuration. Below, you will see that I have temporarily turned off the other panels, and left only the main one.
